## Description

The idea behind this app came from the situations when we have been to friend's places and wanted to choose some music to play. A lot of the times our mates and ourselves will have some similar songs in common, but we don't want to spend the time building a playlist as we want to hang out with our mates. So, this is where the Spotify Party Playlist Maker comes in. Put in your user names of the friends involved and let us build the playlist for you whilst you get to hang out with your mates. Then play the playlist from the browser or 'follow' the playlist to add it to your own account. 

### UPDATE: After Finishing MVP

We found out that we didn't have the time in the 2.5 days to learn how to create the playlist on Spotify for people to be able to follow the playlist. So for now, we added the links to each song, but in the near future we will add this implementation to make it feel more complete.
We wanted to focus on the visualisation of the data instead of the playlist follow idea. Also, we filtered based on common artists instead of exact songs as we wanted the list to be of a decent size for users.
